# OMEGA-X — Alibaba Cloud AI Catalyst Application

OMEGA-X is an agentic-native enterprise migration and qualification platform designed to reduce the technical friction of moving workloads from AWS to Alibaba Cloud.

This repository contains the application package, architecture notes, business case, pilot plan, evidence framework, and submission checklist for Alibaba Cloud's AI Catalyst Program.

## Current positioning

OMEGA-X is positioned as an **AI-powered enterprise migration qualification and conversion engine** for Alibaba Cloud:

> Discovery → Architecture assessment → IaC translation → Security validation → TCO/ROI analysis → POC/Pilot → Production migration

The project is currently at **Alpha 0.4** according to the submitted project brief. The repository intentionally distinguishes demonstrated capabilities from proposed capabilities and program-dependent assumptions.

## AI Catalyst application snapshot

The public AI Catalyst application asks for company information, Alibaba Cloud ID, whether AI is core technology, the AI use case, estimated monthly AI-resource spend, a company deck URL, and business contact details. See [`APPLICATION/ai-catalyst-form.md`](APPLICATION/ai-catalyst-form.md).

Alibaba Cloud currently documents Model Studio Token Plan as using Credits, with availability currently centered on Singapore for Token Plan. The application therefore avoids presenting a fixed "tokens per month" assumption as a contractual grant entitlement.
